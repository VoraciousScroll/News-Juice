piano line on The Fray's 2005 hit \"Over My Head (Cable Car),\" so to avoid being sued like Ed Sheeran or Demi Lovato, The Chainsmokers just went ahead and gave them credit for the riff.\n The Fray's guitarist Joe King acknowledged the nod on Instagram last week, writing that he was \"thrilled to be a part of the #1 song in the country right now.\"\n I guess you never know when a tiny part of your
